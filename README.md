# Stuffs

I created this repository to put all my small study projects in one place. 
As it is unfortunately not yet possible to create a group to nest all projects on GitHub I chose to create a single repository uniting everything.

The commits timeline is a little cluttered at first, because I had to use `git rebase` to prefix the projects names in the commits.
